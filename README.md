# Demand Forecasting for Retail Stores

## This project demonstrates the implementation of a demand forecasting system for retail stores using Python. The project features a machine learning-based system where:

- Historical sales data is collected, cleaned, and prepared for modeling.
- Machine learning models are trained to predict future product demand based on the data.
- The predictions enable stores to optimize inventory levels, minimize costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

This project provides a practical application of data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges in inventory management and supply chain optimization.

## How to Set Up the Demand Forecasting System
1. Install Python and Required Libraries
   - Download and install python 3.9+ and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn and seaborn.
2. Clone repository on local machine using git.
3. Create a project directory.
4. Prepare the dataset
   - collect the data from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aswathrao/demand-forecasting.
   - Save the dataset as a CSV file.
5. Implement the script.
6. Run the script.
7. Analyze result

## Limitations
This implementation assumes the dataset is clean and well-structured.
Advanced feature engineering and model fine-tuning may be required for highly accurate predictions.
External factors like unexpected events or economic changes may impact the accuracy of predictions.

## How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and transformed to create meaningful features for modeling.
2. Model Training: Machine learning models are trained on historical data to learn demand patterns.
3. Demand Prediction: The trained model predicts future demand, enabling stores to make informed decisions about inventory management.
